### CHANGES
* Introduced --expandTypography: true|false to enable/disable automatic expansion of typography types (default: false)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* If you want your typography to be expanded to single values you need to use --expandTypography=true from now on. E.g. `node token-transformer input.json output.json --expandTypography=false`
